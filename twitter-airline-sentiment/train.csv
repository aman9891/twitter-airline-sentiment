negative,@jetblue terrible landing on 915
negative,@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
negative,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
negative,@SouthwestAir okay I understand a delay one way. But both ways? C'mon #annoyed #flights
neutral,@AmericanAir followed!  Sure hope you can help!

neutral,@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?

positive,@USAirways Oh well. I'll get to Cancun eventually.
negative,@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
neutral,@SouthwestAir sent
negative,@USAirways I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia
negative,@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
neutral,@USAirways New marketing song? let us know what you think?
positive,@JetBlue sure is 💙

negative,"@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag."
negative,@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
negative,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
positive,@JetBlue Gary who is serving us at FLL airport counter is really TRUE BLUE! Makes me feel at home even when a JetBlue flight is delayedl
positive,"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3"
negative,@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
negative,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
neutral,"@United just played the Most bizarre ""safety"" video I've ever seen..."
negative,@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937

neutral,"@USAirways yes, with Delta!"
negative,@USAirways now what? You Cancelled Flightled my flight again... Are you paying for my hotel?
negative,"@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?"
neutral,"@USAirways Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets?"
negative,"@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care"
negative,"@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but..."
negative,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
neutral,@united I'll be calling tomorrow
negative,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
negative,@JetBlue I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight.

neutral,@AmericanAir it's flight 5348
negative,"@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site."
negative,@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
negative,@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 😒

positive,@JetBlue Great thank you!
negative,@USAirways according to @wtop DCA seems to be recovering nicely from yesterday's snow so why are you Cancelled Flightling flights out there?
positive,"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
negative,"@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!"
positive,@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
negative,@SouthwestAir flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won't let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help
